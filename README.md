This is a combined research project for both Ruderal Witchcraft and the Coven Intelligence Program.

Project initiated by Margaretha Haughwout at Anderson Ranch, 2025 with some elements developed at DM 2023. Crop images are being run through Color-based segmentation, exploiting the spectral differences between crops and weeds. This includes using color indices like the Excess Green Index (ExG) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to distinguish vegetation from soil and differentiate between plant types based on their spectral signatures. Shape and morphological analysis leverages the distinct structural differences between crops and weeds. Techniques include analyzing leaf shape descriptors, plant architecture patterns, growth habit characteristics, and using morphological operations to identify specific plant features like leaf edges, stems, and overall plant silhouettes. Texture analysis examines surface patterns and spatial arrangements of pixels to distinguish between different plant species. This includes using methods like Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Gabor filters to capture texture characteristics unique to weeds versus crops. Advanced imaging techniques like Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging capture information across multiple wavelengths, revealing spectral signatures that are invisible to human eyes but distinctive for different plant species. This includes using near-infrared (NIR) and thermal imaging for enhanced plant discrimination. This code uses multispectral imaging, but not hyperspectral. Next steps:
  -include hyperspectral imaging,
  -include machine learning and deep learning approaches:
      - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with architectures like ResNet, VGG, and custom CNN models 
      - Traditional machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) )often used in combination with hand-crafted features for weed classification)
      - Object detection frameworks like YOLO (You Only Look Once), R-CNN variants, and SSD (Single Shot Detector) are adapted for real-time weed detection
